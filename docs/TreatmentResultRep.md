# LaunchDarklyApi.TreatmentResultRep

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**treatmentId** | **String** | The ID of the treatment | [optional] 
**treatmentName** | **String** | The name of the treatment | [optional] 
**mean** | **Number** | The average value of the variation in this sample. It doesnâ€™t capture the uncertainty in the measurement, so it should not be the only measurement you use to make decisions. | [optional] 
**dataMean** | **Number** | The mean of the data, with no priors effecting the result. | [optional] 
**dataStdDev** | **Number** | The standard deviation of the data, with no priors effecting the result. | [optional] 
**credibleInterval** | [**CredibleIntervalRep**](CredibleIntervalRep.md) |  | [optional] 
**pBest** | **Number** | The likelihood that this variation has the biggest effect on the primary metric. The variation with the highest probability is likely the best of the variations you&#39;re testing | [optional] 
**relativeDifferences** | [**[RelativeDifferenceRep]**](RelativeDifferenceRep.md) | Estimates of the relative difference between this treatment&#39;s mean and the mean of each other treatment | [optional] 
**units** | **Number** | The number of units exposed to this treatment that have event values, including those that are configured to default to 0 | [optional] 
**traffic** | **Number** | The number of units exposed to this treatment. | [optional] 
**eventValuesSum** | **Number** | The sum of the event values for the units exposed to this treatment. | [optional] 
**distribution** | [**Distribution**](Distribution.md) |  | [optional] 
**correlation** | **Number** | The outcome-covariate correlation | [optional] 
**standardDeviationRatio** | **Number** | The ratio of the outcome SD to covariate SD | [optional] 
**covariateImbalance** | **Number** | The imbalance between the covariate mean for the arm and the covariate mean for the experiment | [optional] 
**varianceReduction** | **Number** | The reduction in variance resulting from CUPED | [optional] 
**model** | **String** | The model used to calculate the results. Parameters specific to this model will be defined under the field under the same name | [optional] 
**bayesianNormal** | [**BayesianNormalStatsRep**](BayesianNormalStatsRep.md) |  | [optional] 
**bayesianBeta** | [**BayesianBetaBinomialStatsRep**](BayesianBetaBinomialStatsRep.md) |  | [optional]
